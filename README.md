## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
To check how the sales and revenue for each product, Power BI would be used for drilling down the specific tables of products for monthly insights details inspection. 
Also, SQL joined some of the tables and got the cost and profit for classification and regression modeling purposes. 
Lastly, processed accuracy testing and prediction by using Python scripts.

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, type:
```
!dict word
```
The first part, i.e. "!dict" **is not** case sensitive.

The bot will then give you the Oxford Dictionary (or Urban Dictionary; if the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary) definition of the word as a comment reply.

### Example:

> !dict what is love

**Definition:**

Baby, dont hurt me~
Dont hurt me~ no more.

**Example:**

Dude1: Bruh, what is love?
Dude2: Baby, dont hurt me, dont hurt me- no more!
Dude1: dafuq?

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.
